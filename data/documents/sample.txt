The key feature of this idiomatic usage is that the majority of code is simply creating a module level logger with getLogger(__name__), 
and using that logger to do any needed logging. This is concise, while allowing downstream code fine-grained control if needed. 
Logged messages to the module-level logger get forwarded to handlers of loggers in higher-level modules, all the way up to the highest-level logger known as the root logger; 
this approach is known as hierarchical logging.

For logging to be useful, it needs to be configured: setting the levels and destinations for each logger, potentially changing how specific modules log, 
often based on command-line arguments or application configuration. In most cases, like the one above, only the root logger needs to be so configured,
 since all the lower level loggers at module level eventually forward their messages to its handlers. basicConfig() provides a quick way to configure 
 the root logger that handles many use cases.
